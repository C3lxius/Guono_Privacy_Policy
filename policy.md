# Guọnọ Dictionary – Privacy Policy

### Effective Upon Use

Guọnọ Dictionary (“**Guọnọ**” & “**App**”) is committed to protecting your personal information and
ensuring transparency in our data practices. We have adopted a Plain Language Privacy Policy
approach—meaning our policy is written in concise, accessible language to help you clearly
understand how your information is collected, used, and protected. For further details on our
plain language practices, please visit our Plain Language Policy page.
This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that
data. It is designed to comply with applicable Korean laws—including the Personal Information
Protection Act (PIPA)—and international data protection standards.

### 1. What Data We Collect
For registration purposes, we collect the following personal information:

● Full Name

● Email Address

● Gender

Note: We do not collect your date of birth and therefore do not track users’ ages.

### 2. Use of the App and Age Limitations

● **Age Limitation:**

The App is intended for use by individuals who are 14 years of age and older.

● **Minors Under 14:**

Although we do not directly collect age information, if it is determined or disclosed that a
user is under 14, the account will be suspended pending the submission of proper
parental or legal guardian consent. If such consent is not provided within a reasonable
timeframe, the account will be terminated. In cases where parental consent is provided,
a legal guardian must review and agree to the terms and conditions on behalf of the
minor. Access and any data provided by minors under 14 will be handled with extra care and strictly limited to the purposes stated in this policy.

### 3. How We Use Your Data
Your data is used solely for the following purposes:
● **Registration and Account Management:**

To create and manage your account.

● **Communication:**

To send important updates or notifications regarding the App.

● **Service Improvement:**

To analyze usage patterns and enhance the App’s features.

We do not use your personal information for any purposes beyond those described above.


### 4. Data Storage, Retention, and Security
#### a. MongoDB Database

**Secure Storage:**

We store your personal information using MongoDB—a proven, secure database platform.
MongoDB employs robust security measures such as encryption (both at rest and in transit),
strict access controls, and network isolation to protect sensitive data.
Exclusivity of Use:
Your personal data is not sold to or shared with MongoDB or other third-party service providers.
MongoDB is used solely as our secure database storage solution, and any external services we
work with (for example, ad networks) may only access limited data as described in Section 5.

#### b. Data Retention
We retain your personal information for as long as required by Korean and applicable
international laws. Once your data no longer serves its intended purpose, or upon your request
(subject to mandatory retention periods), it will be securely and irreversibly destroyed. For example, certain legal frameworks (such as provisions under the Korean Personal Information
Protection Act, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and other relevant laws) may
require us to retain data for periods typically ranging from 3 to 5 years after a deletion request for audit, compliance, or legal obligations.

#### c. Access and Security Controls
Access to your personal information is strictly limited to designated personnel within Guọnọ
Dictionary. We maintain robust data security through industry-standard measures and conduct
periodic compliance reviews to ensure that our security practices remain effective.

5. Advertising and Data Usage for Ads

● **Ad Integration:**

The App may feature advertisements provided by third-party ad networks. These ad
networks may collect and process certain data—such as device identifiers, usage data,
and other technical information—in order to serve personalized or contextual ads and to
measure the effectiveness of the ad campaigns.


● **Data Sharing for Advertising:**

While we do not directly collect additional personal information for advertising purposes,
some of the data we collect (e.g., device information and usage patterns) may be shared
with or accessed by our advertising partners in accordance with their own privacy
policies. We ensure that such partners are required to protect your data in a manner
consistent with our own privacy practices and applicable laws.

● **User Control:**

You may have options to manage your preferences for personalized advertising. For
example, many ad networks provide settings or opt-out mechanisms which you can
adjust via your device or within the ad’s own settings interface.

● **Transparency:**

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party advertising providers
integrated with the App for additional information on how your data may be used for
advertising purposes.


#### 6. Compliance and Reviews

While we do not conduct formal regular audits, we perform periodic compliance reviews to
ensure that our data management practices meet both Korean legal requirements and our
internal security standards. We are dedicated to updating our practices as necessary to
maintain the highest level of data protection.


#### 7. Your Rights and Choices
● **Access & Correction:**

You have the right to request access to or correction of your personal data.

● **Deletion:**

You may request deletion of your account and associated data, subject to the retention
periods required by law.

● **Contacting Us:**

If you wish to exercise your rights or have any inquiries regarding your personal data,
please contact us through our official contact form on our website or via our official social
media channels. Details for these channels are available on our website.

#### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect changes in our
practices or regulatory requirements. Should significant changes be made that affect your
personal data, we will notify you via the App and update the effective date accordingly.


By using **Guọnọ Dictionary**, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy
Policy and agree to its terms. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please discontinue using the App.
